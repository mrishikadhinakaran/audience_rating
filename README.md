# Audience Rating Project

Welcome to the **audience_rating** project! This repository is designed for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing audience ratings for various types of content—such as movies, TV shows, or other media—using modern data science techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into audience preferences and feedback by aggregating and analyzing rating data. It can be used to understand trends, compare content, and support data-driven decision making for content creators, marketers, or researchers.

## Features

- **Data Collection:**  
  - Gathers audience ratings from datasets or APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Cleans and prepares data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Computes summary statistics and identifies trends.
- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Visualizes rating distributions and trends using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Modeling (Optional):**  
  - Applies machine learning models to predict audience ratings based on content features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Optional, for machine learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Optional, for interactive development)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```

git clone https://github.com/mrishikadhinakaran/audience_rating.git
cd audience_rating

```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
*(If you don’t have a requirements file, install the packages listed above.)*

3. **Run the Scripts:**
- Open the main script or Jupyter notebook in your Python environment.
- Follow the instructions to load, preprocess, and analyze the data.
- Visualize the results as described.

4. **Explore the Results:**
- Review summary statistics and visualizations.
- Examine trends and insights from the audience rating data.

## Example

Below is a simplified example of how to use the project:

```

import pandas as pd
from src.preprocess import preprocess_data
from src.analyze import analyze_ratings

# Load and preprocess data

data = pd.read_csv('data/ratings.csv')
cleaned_data = preprocess_data(data)

# Analyze ratings

summary = analyze_ratings(cleaned_data)
print(summary)
